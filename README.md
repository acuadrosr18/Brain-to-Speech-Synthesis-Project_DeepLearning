## Project Description
> The purpose of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is to provide a natural or near-natural channel of communication for people who cannot speak due to physical or neurological impairment.
> Speech is the primary and most essential means of human communication. However, many people have lost this ability through illness or ill health. The real-time synthesis of speech directly from measured neural activity (BRAIN2SPEECH) would enable natural speech and significantly improve quality of life, especially for severely communication-impaired individuals.
> As students, we will study the BRAIN2SPEECH domain and then develop and train new types of neural network architectures.
> The data implemented in the project is the **Dataset of Speech Production in intracranial Electroencephalography** (SingleWordProductionDutch), available [here](https://osf.io/nrgx6/) .
> The related github repository contains a linear regression model which should be replaced by deep neural networks.
> Basic task: train/valid/test set from single speaker.

# Milestone 1: Data acqusition, Data preparation

- indicating the data source, and how you downloaded it
- Data exploration, visualization (if necessary).
- Preparing data for training.
- Final output: training, validation and test inputs and outputs.

For the solution, create a GitHub repository for your group with the following in readme.MD: team name, team members' names and Neptune codes, project description, functions of the files in the repo, and how to run it (if ipynb, just specify the file name) 

The GitHub repo should also contain the Python script or IPYNB that performs the above tasks. 

In this assignment, you just have to submit the URL of the solution.
